**Project Title: Credit Card Fraud Prediction**

Description: 
- Important that credit card companies are able to detect fraudulent transactions so that customers aren't charged for items they didn't purchase. I will predict the transactions of these fraudulant statements. 

3. What is the target?
- Class
4. What does one row represent?
- The rows represent the transaction of the individual. 
5. Is this a classification or regression problem?
- Classification
6. How many features does the data have?
- 30
7. How many rows are in the dataset?
- 20414
8. What, if any, challenges do you foresee in cleaning, exploring, or modeling with this dataset?
- I can see that it can be tough to determine the classes. It is an unbalanced data.
